# Sequence (SQNC) Identity Service

## Description

A `Node.js` API to support communication to the [Substrate-based](https://www.substrate.io/) [`sqnc-node`](https://github.com/digicatapult/sqnc-node) (via [`polkadot-js/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/api)) and an [`IPFS`](https://ipfs.io/) node.

## Getting started

First, ensure you're running the correct [version](.node-version) of `npm`, then install dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

Bring up dependency services (PostgreSQL, [`sqnc-node`](https://github.com/digicatapult/sqnc-node) and Keycloak) with

```
docker-compose up -d
```

And run the DB migrations

```
npm run db:migrate
```

## Environment Variables

`sqnc-identity-service` is configured primarily using environment variables as follows:

## Running the API

Having ensured dependencies are installed and running + the relevant environment variables are set, the API can be started in production mode with

```
npm run build
```

Then

```
npm start
```

To run in a development environment it may be helpful to instead run with

```
npm run dev
```

## API specification

The API is authenticated using the Oauth2 client-credentials flow. When using the docker-compose workflow for development a keycloak instance is deployed with a preconfigured client `sqnc-identity-service` with secret `secret`. These can be entered on the swagger ui at [http://localhost:3000/swagger](http://localhost:3000/swagger) for experimenting with the API.

### GET /members

The `address` parameter identifies the user running this process, and the `alias` representing a more friendly name version of this. The default value of the latter is null, and is optionally set.

```json
[
  {
    "address": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
    "alias": "ALICE"
  }
]
```

### PUT /members/:address

The `address` parameter identifies the user running this process, and the `alias` representing a more friendly name version of this. The default value of the latter is null, and is optionally set.

```json
{
  "address": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY",
  "alias": "ALICE_UPDATED"
}
```
